Project Title: Interactive Rope Simulation
Description
This project is an interactive simulation of a rope composed of multiple segments, demonstrating principles of physics through visual representation. Users can engage with the simulation by moving their mouse or touching the screen, causing the rope segments to react as if they are influenced by gravity and user interaction.

Features
Dynamic Rope Simulation: The simulation consists of multiple rope segments connected by joints, allowing for realistic movement and interactions.
User Interaction: Users can manipulate the rope by hovering their mouse or touching the screen, making it appear as if the rope is being pulled or pushed.
Visual Effects: Each segment of the rope is rendered with a light effect, adding an engaging aesthetic to the simulation.
Responsive Design: The canvas adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the web application.
CSS3: For styling the canvas and layout.
JavaScript: For implementing the simulation logic and handling user interactions.
Canvas API: To render graphics on the HTML canvas.
